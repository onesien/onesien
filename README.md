### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Are you here on purpose because you think I am an amazing developer and want to see what amazing things I am working on (psyche!)? Or perhaps you clicked on my pic while reviewing a git blame (sorry)? Or maybe it was a complete accident? However you happen to be reading this, Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working at an amazing company called [Till](hellotill.com).  <= you should totally click that link too!

... more to come :-)
